## Installation

Installation is easy as angular-ui-bootstrap has minimal dependencies - only the AngularJS and Bootstrap's CSS are required.
After downloading dependencies (or better yet, referencing them from your favourite CDN) you need to download build version of this project. All the files and their purposes are described here: 
https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/tree/gh-pages#build-files
Don't worry, if you are not sure which file to take, opt for `ui-bootstrap-tpls-[version].min.js`.
